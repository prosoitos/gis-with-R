## Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis with R

Do you want to learn Spatial Data Analysis but don't know where to start? This workshop is for you! 


R is a popular programming language for data analysis specially suited for statistical computing and data plotting.  This introductory level workshop discusses basic commands of the programming language and it is specially tailored 
for using R in conjunction with Geographic Information Systems, e.g., [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).




## Goal of this workshop

Our goal is to **begin** to understand and use R for spatial data analysis. You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You will probably not even feel very comfortable using R. This is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using R takes practice.


At the end of the workshop, we expect that you can:

* understand the basic commands of R and how to use RStudio environment;

* know the basic data structures available for GIS;

* load, preprocess, and explore spatial data in R; and

* apply basic operations for creating and extending map data with R

* recognize how the methodology hereby applied extend to other disciplines

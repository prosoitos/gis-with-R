___


Hue
{: .label .label-yellow }
Hue is one of the main properties of a color, it is the perceptual dimension associated with color names, e.g., red, gree, or blue. Typically, we use different hues to represent different categories of data such as when representing neighborhoods:

___


Lightness
{: .label .label-yellow }
Also known as Brightness, is a representation of variation in the perception of a color or color space's brightness.
Lightness is an important dimension for representing ordinal/interval/ratio data. For our income map, we use three different hues (i.e., green, yellow, and orange) with decreasing lightness values for them.

___

Saturation
{: .label .label-yellow }
Saturation is the intensity of a hue from gray tone (no saturation) to pure, vivid color (high saturation).
Gimond advises care when manipulating saturation. It should be modified sparingly in most maps.

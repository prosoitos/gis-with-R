[source](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/)


Students want to write a petition asking for the construction of schools, community centres, and other recreation facilities for certain neighbourhoods. 
They want support from the local news and, instead of anedoctal data, **they come armed with science and knowledge!!!**

- What is the density of services in Vancouver's neighbourhoods? 
- Are services concentrated in accessible regions? 
- Does income of citizens in a neighbourhood influece service density?

### Approach


To address this problem, we follow one or more steps from [Ben Fry's data visualization pipeline](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/visualizing-data/9780596514556/ch01.html):

1. **Acquire**
    Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a source over a network.
1. **Parse**
    Provide some structure for the dataâ€™s meaning, and order it into categories.
1. **Filter**
    Remove all but the data of interest.
1. **Mine**
    Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context.
1. **Represent**
    Choose a basic visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree.
1. **Refine**
    Improve the basic representation to make it clearer and more visually engaging.
1. **Interact**
    Add methods for manipulating the data or controlling what features are visible.

## dplyr

Quadrat density did not make use of the polygons representing each neighbourhood. Can we count the number of services
for a given neighbourhood?


R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
head(vancouver_boundaries$mapid)
```

Output
{: .label .label-yellow }
```R
[1] AR   CBD  FAIR GW   HS   MARP
Levels: AR CBD DS FAIR GW HS KC KERR KIL KITS MARP MP OAK RC RP SC SHAU STR SUN VF WE WPG
```


## *1-2*{: .circle .circle-blue} Finding points within a polygon with filter and st_intersects

The `dplyr` package provides several functionalities for manipulating data, e.g., filtering rows, selecting certain columns, aggregating results, etc. In this workshop, we use the very minimum of the package and we encourage readers to look for more [resources](../resources.md) for using the package. 

First, we can find the polygon of a single neighborhood with `filter`

R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
filtered <- vancouver_boundaries %>% filter(mapid == "MP")
```

Then, we can find all points that are within the boundaries of that polygon using `st_intersects`

R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
st_intersects(filtered, schools)
lengths(st_intersects(filtered, schools))
```



## Finding points for all polygons

We can repeat this process for every neighborhood. However, this could require a lot of coding. 
We can avoid that with a loop over each neighborhood, i.e.: `for (neighbourhood in vancouver_boundaries$mapid)`

R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
lst_cnt <- c()
for (neighbourhood in vancouver_boundaries$mapid) {
  neighbourhood_polygon <- vancouver_boundaries %>% 
    filter(mapid == neighbourhood)

  cnt <- lengths(st_intersects(neighbourhood_polygon, schools))
  lst_cnt <- c(cnt, lst_cnt)
}
lst_cnt
```

Any code inside the curly braces will be repeated for each neighborhood. At the end, `lst_cnt` will have the number of schools for all our data. 

R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
vancouver_boundaries$schools <- lst_cnt
vancouver_boundaries %>%
  pull(mapid, schools)
```

Output
{: .label .label-yellow }
```R
> vancouver_boundaries %>%
+   pull(mapid, schools)
   7    9   21    7    8   17   10    8   11    8    5    8    3    4   
  AR  CBD FAIR   GW   HS MARP   RP SHAU  STR   WE   DS KERR  KIL KITS   
```


## Plotting schools per neighborhood


R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
brks <- classIntervals(vancouver_boundaries$schools, n = 5, style = "quantile")
tm_shape(vancouver_boundaries) + 
  tm_polygons("schools", 
              breaks= brks$brks, title="Seervices",
              border.col = "white", palette = "GnBu") +
  tm_text("schools", just = "center", size = 0.8) +
  tm_legend(outside=TRUE)
```

Output
{: .label .label-yellow }
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/content/fig/plot6.png">




## Exercise

- Count the number of community centres
{: .warn}



## Encapsulating everything in a function

Doing the above for schools, community centres, etc. is quite verbose. Once again, we can wrap everything inside a function:

R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
cnt_services <- function(point_data) {
  lst_cnt <- c()
  for (neighbourhood in vancouver_boundaries$mapid) {
    neighbourhood_polygon <- vancouver_boundaries %>% filter(mapid == neighbourhood)
    cnt <- lengths(st_intersects(neighbourhood_polygon, point_data))
    lst_cnt <- c(cnt, lst_cnt)
  } 
  
  return(lst_cnt)
}
```

The function takes a set of points as input, and it goes over our data finding all points that intersect each neighborhood. Handy, eh?


Now, we can cound schools, libraries, and community centres. We can also sum them in a single variable called `all_services`

R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
vancouver_boundaries$schools <- cnt_services(schools)
vancouver_boundaries$libraries <- cnt_services(libraries)
vancouver_boundaries$community_centres <- cnt_services(community_centres)


vancouver_boundaries$all_services <- vancouver_boundaries$schools + 
  vancouver_boundaries$libraries + 
  vancouver_boundaries$community_centres
```



R Code
{: .label .label-green }
```R
brks <- classIntervals(vancouver_boundaries$all_services, n = 5, style = "quantile")
tm_shape(vancouver_boundaries) + 
  tm_polygons("all_services", 
        breaks= brks$brks, title="Services",
        border.col = "white", palette = "GnBu") +
  tm_text("all_services", just = "center", size = 0.8) +
  tm_legend(outside=TRUE)
```



Output
{: .label .label-yellow }
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/content/fig/plot7.png">



### Recap

- `filter` filter a dataset based on some condition
- `st_intersects` binds a polygon area to a set of points
